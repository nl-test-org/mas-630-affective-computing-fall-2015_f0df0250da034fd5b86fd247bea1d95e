This assignment has two parts:

Part 1
------

Fill out this [Form of Ethical Issues (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/assignment-8/mitmas_630f15_ethical) choosing sides you'd be willing to argue. Prof. Picard will then make assignments and let you know which group you have been assigned.

Part 2
------

1.  What is a potential concern of Affective Computing technology that most worries you? Give one or two lines saying why.
2.  What do you think is the best approach that we (the research community) could take to mitigate or possibly prevent this concern?
3.  Prepare in a PowerPoint file, 1â€“2 slides with bullets or images for your main arguments for the position you'll be arguing in Session 9. (Do not write out the arguments; the bullets are there just to prompt your memory of your main points.) Submit these with your brief answers to 1 and 2.
